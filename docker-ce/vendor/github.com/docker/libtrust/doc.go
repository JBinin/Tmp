Package libtrust provides an interface for managing authentication and
authorization using public key cryptography. Authentication is handled
using the identity attached to the public key and verified through TLS
x509 certificates, a key challenge, or signature. Authorization and
access control is managed through a trust graph distributed between
both remote trust servers and locally cached and managed data.
