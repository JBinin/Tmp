// AliveDelegate is used to involve a client in processing
// a node "alive" message. When a node joins, either through
// a UDP gossip or TCP push/pull, we update the state of
// that node via an alive message. This can be used to filter
// a node out and prevent it from being considered a peer
// using application specific logic.
type AliveDelegate interface {
	// NotifyMerge is invoked when a merge could take place.
	// Provides a list of the nodes known by the peer. If
	// the return value is non-nil, the merge is canceled.
