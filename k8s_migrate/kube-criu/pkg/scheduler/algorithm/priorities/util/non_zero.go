// For each of these resources, a pod that doesn't request the resource explicitly
// will be treated as having requested the amount indicated below, for the purpose
// of computing priority only. This ensures that when scheduling zero-request pods, such
// pods will not all be scheduled to the machine with the smallest in-use request,
// and that when scheduling regular pods, such pods will not see zero-request pods as
// consuming no resources whatsoever. We chose these values to be similar to the
// resources that we give to cluster addon pods (#10653). But they are pretty arbitrary.
// As described in #11713, we use request instead of limit to deal with resource requirements.
