// Package lapack64 provides a set of convenient wrapper functions for LAPACK
// calls, as specified in the netlib standard (www.netlib.org).
//
// The native Go routines are used by default, and the Use function can be used
// to set an alternative implementation.
//
// If the type of matrix (General, Symmetric, etc.) is known and fixed, it is
// used in the wrapper signature. In many cases, however, the type of the matrix
// changes during the call to the routine, for example the matrix is symmetric on
// entry and is triangular on exit. In these cases the correct types should be checked
// in the documentation.
//
// The full set of Lapack functions is very large, and it is not clear that a
// full implementation is desirable, let alone feasible. Please open up an issue
// if there is a specific function you need and/or are willing to implement.
